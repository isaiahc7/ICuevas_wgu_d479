        <h2>Taniti Attractions</h2>
        <p>Entertainment:<br>
        Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano. <br>
        However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, <br>
        zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, <br>
        playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. <br>
        Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. </p>
