        <h2>Taniti Transportation</h2>
       <p>
        Transportation: <br>
        Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. <br>
        Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes.<br>
         Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.

       <p>Ground Transportation: <br>
        Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. <br>
        Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, <br>
        and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. <br>
        Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). <br>
        Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. <br>
        Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
